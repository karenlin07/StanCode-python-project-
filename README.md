A positive integer ‘n’ is selected and you multiply it by 3 and add one if it's odd.<br>
For the even value of ‘n’, keep dividing by 2. Surprisingly, whatever changes the values
of ‘n’ may go through in the process, it will eventually return to 1<br>

##Hangman<br>
The program begins by randomly selecting an English word from a word bank (answer) and represents each letter with dashes.<br> 
Consequently, at the start of the game, the player is presented with a row of dashes equal in length to the answer. In each round, the player inputs an uppercase or lowercase letter (input_ch). If the input_ch is present in the answer, the program updates the dashed representation, revealing all positions where input_ch occurs. However, if input_ch is not part of the answer, the player loses one life. If the player exhausts all seven lives without correctly guessing the answer, the player fails the challenge.<br>
